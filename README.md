## 📌 Project Overview

### Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person infected with COVID-19 will recover or not based on symptom data following **WHO** guidelines.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

- Daily cumulative statistics of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
- 14 key features related to symptoms, comorbidities, and demographic information.
- A binary target variable representing the outcome (Recovered or Not).
